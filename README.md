## **Background**:

<div style="text-align: justify"> InFenTor (Intelligence Finder Detector) is an innovative app designed to address the lack of understanding of children's intelligence types in Indonesia. Many children struggle with determining their potential careers and choosing a role model, which are crucial factors for their success. In response to these challenges, InFenTor offers a solution by providing a user-friendly application to measure children's intelligence types and identify potential careers. The app utilizes a basis of multiple intelligences developed by Howard Gardner. </div>


<div style="text-align: justify"> Using the app is simple: children answer intelligence-related questions, and the application generates personalized results. These results include the child's intelligence type, potential career paths, and famous figures who share the same career, serving as role models. InFenTor aims to empower children by helping them understand their unique intelligence and explore career possibilities. By providing valuable insights and connections to real-life success stories, InFenTor assists children in making informed decisions about their future. </div>

## **Machine Learning**:
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
InFenTor uses Multiclass NLP Texs-Classificatoin to recommend user careers. The user will be given an essay question and then InFenTor will determine a suitable recommendation from the user's answer. InFenTor uses data from kaggle about job descriptions and job resumes, the dataset is combined into 1 
 </div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> [dataset](https://github.com/IchsanAlfian/InfentorApps/blob/Machine-Learning/Dataset_InFenTor.xlsx). For the time being InFenTor recommends only 5 careers (Accountant, Designer, Teacher, IT, and Healthcare). InFenTor is formed by LSTM layer, softmax activation, and has .h5 output.  </div>
